# Slot Machine Game in Python

## Overview
This project is a console-based slot machine simulation written in Python. It allows users to deposit money, place bets across multiple lines, and spin the slot machine to see the outcomes. The game is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates concepts like:
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Working with loops and conditionals
- Dictionary operations

## Features
1. **Deposit Amount**: Users can deposit funds to play.
2. **Betting System**: Allows users to bet on 1-3 lines with a specified amount.
3. **Slot Machine Spin**: Randomly generates symbols in a 3x3 grid using a weighted symbol system.
4. **Validation**: Ensures bets are within limits and do not exceed the user's current balance.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Save the script to a `.py` file (e.g., `slot_machine.py`).
3. Run the script in the terminal or command prompt:
